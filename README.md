# guessMyNumber

This is a game where you need to guess a random number between 1 and 20.
 The program tells after each guess whether the user guessed too high or too low,
 and it keeps up with the number of guess it took the user to get the correct answer
 which it displays along with a "Correct Number!" message when they get it right.
